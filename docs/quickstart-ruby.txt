Ruby Quickstart
===============

An Example using Sinatra
------------------------

Inside your developer dashboard there is a form for you to enter your callback location.  In this example you would use http;//your-domain.com/login That full url must point to a location that takes a post and processes the SAML response.  This is an example using Sinatra that would do that for you.

    :::ruby
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'ruby-saml'
    require 'sinatra/base'
    class Application < Sinatra::Base
      
      post '/login' do
        settings                        = Onelogin::Saml::Settings.new
        settings.idp_cert_fingerprint   = "e019441a82f1f2ebfc42397aea85b7b5f398562c"
        settings.name_identifier_format = "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent"

        response          = Onelogin::Saml::Response.new(params[:SAMLResponse])
        response.settings = settings
        session[:user_id] = response.name_id

        # ...
      end
    end

You can now use the string found in session[:user_id] to uniquely identify the user.  Use that as a key to associate data with the user etc.

If you're looking for data provided by Third Party Providers through Sitepass you look in response.attributes for example

    :::ruby
    @name  = response.attributes[:name]
    @email = response.attributes[:email]
